# Cataract-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
Welcome to our cataract prediction tutorial, where we will explore the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to diagnose cataract with a remarkable 96% accuracy. 
Cataract is a common medical condition that can lead to vision loss if not detected and treated in time. 
Machine learning makes it possible to make early and precise diagnoses.
